# Dopamine-Triggering Indicators in Children's YouTube Videos

## üìÑ Description
This dataset contains **500 manually annotated records** of dopamine-inducing features from **YouTube videos targeted at children**, alongside a control set of **non-children content**. It was curated to support **comparative behavioral analysis** between child-specific media and general YouTube content.

## üß™ Research Context

This dataset was created as part of a dopamine-based research project using machine learning techniques, focusing on behavioral triggers in children's video content. The associated academic paper is under preparation and will be linked here upon publication (planned submission to arXiv).

## üõ†Ô∏è Annotation Methodology

- **video_id**: Extracted from the unique YouTube video URL.
- **channel_name**: As listed on YouTube.
- **video_title**: Cleaned version of the video title (special characters removed when necessary).
- **freq_cut_per_video**: Manually annotated presence of frequent scene cuts; only binary observation noted.
- **video_duration_sec**: Converted to seconds for standardization.
- **dominant_color**: Most persistent color observed in the video‚Äôs frames.
- **view_count**: Snapshot of views at the time of annotation.
- **title_word_count**: Counted after cleaning punctuation/symbols.
- **video_category**: Assigned based on YouTube classification and contextual judgment.
- **is_for_kids**: Based on YouTube‚Äôs ‚ÄúMade for Kids‚Äù tag.
- **date_published**: As listed by the video creator, formatted as DD-MM-YYYY.
- **key_dopamine_factor**: Major trigger features like **familiarity**, **animation**, or **music repetition**; "No Dominant Factor" if none detected.
- **dopamine_label**: Binary label manually assigned based on holistic feature evaluation. It reflects annotation judgment and is **not a definitive neuropsychological metric**.

## Annotation Details

This dataset was manually annotated by two contributors to ensure diverse perspectives and minimize bias in identifying dopamine-triggering content:

- **250 videos annotated by a male annotator (Sanjay)**
- **250 videos annotated by a female annotator (Jivanthikaa)**

Each annotator followed a consistent set of dopamine-triggering criteria based on behavioral patterns such as repetitive music, jump cuts, fast pacing, exaggerated sounds, and vivid colors. Ambiguous cases were reviewed collaboratively.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset was carefully constructed to maintain **class balance** for key binary labels:

- `dopamine_label`:  
  - **250 videos labeled `1` (dopamine-triggering)**  
  - **250 videos labeled `0` (not dopamine-triggering)**

- `is_for_kids`:  
  - **250 videos marked as designed for children**  
  - **250 videos not specifically intended for children**

This balance allows for unbiased training and evaluation in downstream machine learning tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

- All annotations are **manual** and may contain **subjective bias or human error**.
- **View counts** represent values at the time of annotation and may not be current.
- The dataset is designed for **experimental research only**, not clinical applications.
